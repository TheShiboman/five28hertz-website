🌍 The Legacy – ProAct World
The Foundation That Built five28hertz
Before five28hertz became a movement for global transformation, it was built on the legacy of ProAct World—a pioneering force in direct marketing and business solutions across the Middle East.

🌟 The ProAct World Story
Founded in 1998, ProAct World revolutionized consumer engagement, business intelligence, and data-driven marketing. With global brands like Procter & Gamble, ExxonMobil, Coca-Cola, Nokia, Visa, and many more, it reshaped the industry through:
✅ People-to-people marketing & consumer activation.
✅ Trade marketing & retail innovation.
✅ Strategic CRM, data analytics, and GIS mapping.
✅ Large-scale education & community engagement programs.

For two decades, ProAct World led the way in business transformation, serving as a launchpad for the future.

But evolution is inevitable. With a vision beyond marketing—one focused on global well-being and transformative experiences—five28hertz was born.

🚀 From Business to Global Transformation
The same principles that made ProAct World a leader—knowledge, ethics, leadership, and service—are now woven into five28hertz. Today, five28hertz expands beyond marketing into industries that transform lives:

✅ Technology & Innovation – ExchangeSphere: A peer-to-peer sharing economy platform.
✅ Real Estate & Hospitality – Argento Homes: AI-powered, luxury short-term stays.
✅ Sports & Lifestyle – QXT World: Redefining cue sports entertainment.
✅ Media & Wellness – 528Hz Blog & Podcast: Well-being, knowledge, and inspiration.
